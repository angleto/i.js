i.js

Hello
-----

I have always admired IPython Notebook as the unique tool for interactive computing, however I was craving to be able to use a similar environment for JavaScript. There are a few reasons for that:

* First of all I often need to run JS experiments. While browser's console and JS REPL are reasonable approximations of this, I was spoiled by the IPython iterative evaluation and ability to run repetitive experiments while modifying the parts that require such modifications.
* Second: matplotlib. Like seriously, IPython? I want to have d3.js. While this is possible to get it IPython right now - it is, in my opinion, so convoluted that it kills the fun.
* Third, because IPython Notebook is a unique tool that represents an amazing new paradigm for doing research and running experiments, so it should be made available to the wides audience possible, go see yourself: http://ipython.org
